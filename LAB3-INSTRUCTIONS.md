#### Background

Setting up accounts on a system can be a difficult task to do securely.  
In part one students will work in groups of 3 to setup multiple users on your 
WSL environment.  Students will extract information from this virtual machine 
and document the process.

Parts 2 and 3 will involve checking and changing file permissions.

---

#### Objectives

Students should become familiar with the following:

* using encryption to secure communication within a team
* following instructions
* Standard authentication methods in linux
* File permissions in linux
* Special file permissions in linux

### Task 1 - Users

Intended to be done in a team of 2-3, but a single person *could* perform
all tasks.  ***All work should be done by each student***

* create a simple / insecure password you can share 
  (one or two words and numbers, no padding or substitution)
* create an SSH key pair for yourself and swap public keys with teammates
* exchange (insecure) passwords using gpg encryption (use the `--recipient` option)
* create ***a local account for each team member*** using the above
* Back up the `/etc/shadow` file entries for these users ***Submit this file to the pilot dropbox by next Thursday***

***Input needed in `README.md`***

---

### Task 2 - Permissions

It appears someone on your system *might* have used an insecure password.
Lets lock some things down.

* Check the permissions on each users home directory `~` (their username folder in `/home`)
* Change each users' home directory (and all contents of) permissions so only the file owner (`u`) and file group (`g`) can read/write/execute files.
* Check the permissions on `/etc/shadow`
* Using standard linux file permissions (no setfacl), allow ***your user***  read access to your teammates local home directories.

---

### Task 3 - SetUID

The SetUID and SetGID bits can be tricky to think about.  Check out the 
`/code` provided to you in this lab.  Edit this as necessary to allow
***ANY*** user on this system to list contents of your home directory 
(using the executable generated by this code).

* Edit the code as necessary and compile
* Check ownership of this file
* Set the SetUID bit of this file
* Make sure others can read/execute this file
* Verify your teammates have successfully performed this task

Hints: This will require some tweaking of the code and environment.  
Some useful commands: 
* `g++ <filename>`
* `man whoami`
* `./a.out whoami`
